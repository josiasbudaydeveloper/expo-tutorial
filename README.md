# Expo Tutorial

This is the official Expo tutorial. Expo is the most popular
React Native framework and also the most complete one. Expo have
an extended API allowing for using many native capabilities, such as
the file system, the gallery, GPS, camera, etc. Another valuable resource 
and, in my case, the most important one, is Expo Go, an application for 
Android and iOS that allows us to test our apps during the development phase
without needing to install them into our devices, which is specially hard and
expensive to do on iOS, and it happens in real time: all that we need to do is
scan the QR code shown in the terminal when we start the development server and
our app will be automatically loaded into Expo Go, which already have all the libraries
needed to run the code we write, as long as we don't use any custom native code. If we need 
to use custom native code in our apps, we will need to use a build development of Expo Go 
installed on our devices. It's just like a personalized version of Expo Go on our devices, 
which can be created using the EAS (Expo Application Services), the cloud services of Expo.
